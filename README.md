# Generative Fashion Search System

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to build a generative search system using LlamaIndex and a language model (LLM) that allows users to search through a large dataset of fashion products based on natural language queries. The system is designed to understand the semantics of user queries, process fashion product descriptions, and return relevant product results based on various attributes like color, style, price, and other fashion-specific features.

### Features:
- Search for fashion products (e.g., clothing items) using natural language queries.
- Filter results by attributes such as color, style, occasion, fabric, and more.
- Leverages the latest techniques in generative search using LlamaIndex and LLM.

## Dataset

The project uses the Myntra Fashion Product dataset from Kaggle:
- **Source**: [Myntra Fashion Product Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/djagatiya/myntra-fashion-product-dataset)
- The dataset contains images, descriptions, ratings, brands, and other attributes related to various fashion items.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - LlamaIndex
  - pandas
  - OpenAI (if using OpenAI for LLM)
  - Additional dependencies as per the code

## Project Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd generative-fashion-search
   
# Execute search engine with below code

userinput="Blue Tshirts"
initiateSearch(userinput)
